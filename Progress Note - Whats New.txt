In this build (Date 9-3-2022) we implemented the key-file (deckey.txt) based
decryption of the encrypted passwords from the <Encrypted Password Storage.txt>!
Please keep these two files (deckey.txt & Encrypted Password Storage.txt) in 
a safe place if you are planning to use this python program to keep your
passwords safe!
The key-file is automatically used for decryption once the program is launched
from the same folder as <deckey.txt>.
Text copying support is planned for the next build.
