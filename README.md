Welcome to our password generator, in development by inf2021198 &amp; inf2021221 &amp; inf2021119 for our university project

This a simple and secure app that uses AES encryption to encrypt and decrypt your passwords, it is fully offline and requires the following libraries to work (**if you run the python script and not the standalone version which has the .exe extension**):
  1. AES-Encryptor
  2. pyperclip
  3. pycryptodome

Open your command prompt (not the python idle!) and type **pip install packagename** where package name is the name of each of the above libraries (type the names exactly as shown above)

If you have any questions or suggestions, ill be here to help
