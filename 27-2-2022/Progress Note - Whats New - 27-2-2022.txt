In this build (Date 27-2-2022) we added the option of saving the
generated password to a text file which supports the addition of
multiple passwords with the method of appending, each password
can have it's own desired name if the user chooses to provide
one. Also, soon, we will add the encryption feature to our
generator and the option to save the password both encrypted
and decrypted in the <Encrypted Password Storage.txt>.
