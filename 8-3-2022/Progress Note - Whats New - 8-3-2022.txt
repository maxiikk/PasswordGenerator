In this build (Date 8-3-2022) we made a GUI and added the main
features even though the decryption does not work with a master
password yet, we plan to use a key-file instead of a master
password due to a malfunction of the Pycrypto installer that had
all the "encrypt with a password" functions, but we will do that
just to not be bothered by the encryption method and continue on
implementing other features and get back to the Pycrypto once its
fixed.
