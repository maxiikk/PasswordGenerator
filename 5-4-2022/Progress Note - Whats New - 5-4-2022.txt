In this build (Date 5-4-2022) we finally added password-based
encryption & decryption! Since the popular modules would not
install on our system for some reason, we didnt stop searching
for alternatives, and here we are, we found an encryption
module that was easy to install and setup! Now, to set up
a password for the encryption & decryption of the passwords
you should enter it every time you launch the program so the
program will automatically decrypt the saved passwords and
encrypt the new passwords!
